## Individual project
  ### Project description
For my individual project I am going to make an order picking system. In this system, customers can order products online and order pickers can prepare these orders. For picking the order, the system will create an optimal route so that you only have to go through the shop once. If an item cannot be picked completely, the user will receive an e-mail about the discrepancy.
