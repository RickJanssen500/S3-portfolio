## Individual project
  ### Project description
For my individual project I am going to make an order picking system. In this system, customers can order products online and order pickers can prepare these orders. For picking the order, the system will create an optimal route so that you only have to go through the shop once. If an item cannot be picked completely, the user will receive an e-mail about the discrepancy.

   ### User Storys

- A **Customer** can create an order.
- A **picker** gets the most efficient route to pick the order.
- A **picker** has to scan the product to confirm itâ€™s the correct product.
- A **customer** can set the pickup time.
- A **picker** knows at what temperate to store the picked order.
- A **picker** specify the amount he picks of a product, if the amount differs from the order the customer gets a email notification.
- The **customer** gets email confirmation when placing an order.
