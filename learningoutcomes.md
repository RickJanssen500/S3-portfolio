## Learning outcomes

   ### 1 You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications. IP and GP
   ### 2 You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development. IP only
   ### 3 You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project. GP only
   
   We work in an agile process in our group project. Every Day we start with the daily stand-up, mostly around 09:30 becouse the group is complete by then.
   Here we will discuss what everyone has been/will be doing for the day and where we currently stand in the project and what still needs to be done this sprint.
   We will take a look at our notion board and look who is assigned to which task. If somebody isn't assigned to any task, we deside to which task he will we assigned to.
   At the end of the day we have a daily stand-down. Here we will discuss how everything went this day and the progres everyone booked.
   Sometimes we also have meetings before or after lunch break to make sure everyone can keep working and won't get stuck add a problem.

We end every sprint with a sprint review and a sprint retrospective. The sprint review is with the product owner.
We will delivere our work from the sprint and get feedback from the product owner.
then we discuss what we are aiming to do next sprint and see if it is in line with the client's expectations.
After the sprint review we will do the sprint retrospective.
In which we will look at what went well, what can be improved and what went bad. We do this by asking ourselves a lot of questions.
We then adapt our working methods to the findings of the retrospective.
