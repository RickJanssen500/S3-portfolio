##Learning outcomes

   ### 1 You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications. IP and GP
   ### 2 You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development. IP only
   ### 3 You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project. GP only
   
   We work in an agile process in our group project. Every morning we start with the daily stand-up.
   Here we will discuss what everyone will be doing for the day and where we currently are in the project (in terms of what is completed and what still needs to be done).
   We will grab our notion board and start assigning tasks (see picture below).
   At the end of the day we will perform the daily stand-down. Here we will discuss how everything went this day.
   Think about problems that may have occurred throughout the day, or things that just didn't go as planned.

We end every sprint with a sprint review and a sprint retrospective. The sprint review is with the product owner.
We will talk about what has priority, we gather feedback to improve our product and we take a look at what we are going to focus on upcoming sprint. 
But most importantly we will deliver parts of the product af often as possible to get as much feedback as possible. 
After the sprint review we will start the sprint retrospective with our group. We will ask ourselves a lot of questions about how it went this sprint. 
If anything is not to our liking, we will inspect it and adapt ourselves to improve it.
